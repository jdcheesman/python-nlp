As a boy, Schwarzenegger played many sports&mdash;heavily influenced by his father.<ref name="tmas"/> He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his Association football|football coach took his team to a local gym.<ref name="lifeline"/> At the age of 14, Schwarzenegger chose bodybuilding over football (soccer) as a career.<ref name="katzfilm">{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0060742143}} </ref><ref name="profilear">{{cite news |title=Profile: Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=2004-08-31 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was age 13 when he started weightlifting: "I actually started weight training when I was fifteen, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting."<ref name="askarnold1"/> However, his official website biography claims: "At 14, he started an intensive training program with Kurt Marnul, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career."<ref name="mrever">{{cite news |title=Mr. Everything |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&subsec=mreverything |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> During a speech in 2001, he said, "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old.

Later, he and the film's producer both stated that this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport, and to make Schwarzenegger's image more cold and machine-like to fan controversy for the film.<ref>Interview in ''Pumping Iron{{ndash}} 25th Anniversary Edition'' DVD extras</ref> Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, has said he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.<ref name="DT2">{{cite news |title=The girl who can't escape Arnie |date=2003-10-06 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/10/02/bfarni02.xml&page=1 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he did not attend his father's funeral.<ref name="wl"/>



In an interview with ''Fortune (magazine)|Fortune'' magazine in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what "would now be called child abuse" at the hands of his father. "My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'you can't do this,' I said, 'this is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'

===Early adulthood===

Schwarzenegger served in the Military of Austria|Austrian army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.<ref name="lifeline"/><ref name="mrever"/> He won the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.<ref name="profilear"/> Schwarzenegger went AWOL during basic training so that he could take part in the competition and spent a week in an army jail: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences. When I got to Stuttgart, I was all confused. I forgot my posing routine, I had to borrow posing trunks, but still I won!"<ref name="askarnold1"/> Contrary to popular belief, it was not Schwarzenegger's bodybuilding debut, which had occurred two years earlier at a minor contest in Graz, at Steirer Hof Hotel (where he had placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous.



"The Universe Championships|Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America{{ndash}} the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich."<ref name="per"/> Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London.<ref name="mrever"/> He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton.<ref name="mrever"/>



Charles "Wag" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training  program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.<ref>Staff. http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece Obituary:Wag Bennett: bodybuilder who helped Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Times, October 2, 2008.

Field, a friend in Munich at that time "I'm going to become the greatest actor!"

Schwarzenegger moved to the United States in September 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English language|English.<ref name="lifeline"/><ref name="profilear"/> "Naturally, when I came to this country, my accent was very bad, and my accent was also very strong, which was an obstacle as I began to pursue acting."<ref name="askarnold1"/> There he trained at Gold's Gym in Santa Monica, California, under Joe Weider. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was Ric Drasin, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.<ref>Jennings, Randy (2003, October 21). http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/archives/2003/october/617.htm ''Ric Drasin: Arnold's lifting partner!''

He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me."<ref name="DT2"/>



Schwarzenegger met his next love, Sue Moray, a Beverly Hills hairdresser's assistant, on Venice Beach in July 1977.<ref name="wl"/> According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: "We were faithful when we were both in LA...but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted."<ref name="wl"/> Schwarzenegger met Maria Shriver at the Robert F.

==Bodybuilding career==

{{seealso|Bodybuilding competitions featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger}}

Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''Muscle & Fitness'' and ''Flex (magazine)|Flex''. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. The magazine ''MuscleMag International'' has a monthly two-page article on him, and refers to him as "The King."



One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.<ref name="lifeline"/> He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.<ref name="lifeline"/><ref name="mrever"/> He would go on to compete in and win many bodybuilding contests, as well as some powerlifting contests, including five Mr. Universe (4{{ndash}} NABBA England, 1{{ndash}} IFBB USA) wins, and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.



===Strongman===

In 1967, Schwarzenegger competed in and won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg/560 lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests. Schwarzenegger has said the following on his size: "During the peak of my career, my calves were 20 inches, thighs 28.5 inches, waist 34 inches, chest 57 inches, and 22-inch arms."



In a full squat (buttocks close to ground) Schwarzenegger had a personal record of 181 kg/400lbs, for twelve repetitions.



===Mr. Olympia===

Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.<ref name="lifeline"/><ref name="mrever"/> His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he holds to this day.<ref name="mrever"/>



He continued his winning streak in the 1971 – 1974 competitions.<ref name="mrever"/> In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,<ref name="mrever"/> beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.<ref name="mrever"/>



Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''Pumping Iron.'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry'' with Jeff Bridges. Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a sixth ''consecutive'' time, Schwarzenegger retired from competition.



Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.<ref name="lifeline"/> Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''Conan the Barbarian (film)|Conan'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding, and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television, when he announced at The Eleventh Hour|the eleventh hour that while he was there: "Why not compete?" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger officially retired from competition.



===Steroid use===

Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1967 that "steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up." He has called the drugs "tissue building."<ref name="Arnold Steroids">{{cite web |title=Arnold & Steroids: Truth Revealed |publisher=get2net |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18 |last=Theunissen |first=Steve}}</ref>



In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted an early death for the bodybuilder, based on a link between steroid use and later heart problems. Because the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a Deutsche Mark|DM20,000 ($12,000 USD) libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with ''The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe'', a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.

==Acting career==

Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's ''Hercules in New York''. Credited under the name "Arnold Strong," his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed after production.<ref name="profilear"/> His second film appearance was as a deaf and speech disorder|mute hit-man for the mob in director Robert Altman|Robert Altman's ''The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry'' (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor|Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career. "It was very difficult for me in the beginning{{ndash}} I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird,' that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."<ref name="askarnold1"/>



Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film ''Pumping Iron'' (1977),<ref name="profilear"/><ref name="katzfilm"/> elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, Schwarzenegger purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |title=The Smoking Gun: Archive |publisher=TheSmokingGun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The Incredible Hulk'', but did not win the role due to his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy ''The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain''.



Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the mythical epic ''Conan the Barbarian (film)|Conan the Barbarian'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.<ref name="katzfilm"/> This was followed by a sequel, ''Conan the Destroyer'' in 1984, although its performance was disappointing.<ref name="tessay">{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=EMPIRE ESSAY: The Terminator |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |work=Empire magazine |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video "Rio Carnival|Carnival in Rio".

During the 1980s, audiences had a large appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars.<ref name="profilear"/> Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his droll, often self-deprecating sense of humor (including sometimes famously bad puns), separating his roles from more serious action hero fare. His alternative-universe comedy/thriller ''Last Action Hero'' featured a poster of the movie ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which, in the fictional alternate universe, had Sylvester Stallone as its star.



Following his arrival as a Hollywood superstar, he made a number of successful films: ''Commando (film)|Commando'' (1985), ''Raw Deal (1986 movie)|Raw Deal'' (1986), ''The Running Man (film)|The Running Man'' (1987), and ''Red Heat'' (1988). In ''Predator (movie)|Predator'' (1987), another successful film, Schwarzenegger led a cast which included future Minnesota List of Governors of Minnesota|Governor Jesse Ventura (Ventura also appeared in ''The Running Man (film)|The Running Man'' and ''Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin'' with Schwarzenegger) and future Kentucky Governor of Kentucky|Gubernatorial candidate Sonny Landham.



''Twins (movie)|Twins'' (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, was a change of pace, and also proved successful. ''Total Recall (film)|Total Recall'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million and 15% of the gross, and was a widely praised, science-fiction script directed by Paul Verhoeven, based on the Philip K. Dick short story, "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale". ''Kindergarten Cop'' (1990) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in ''Twins''.



Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series ''Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt'', entitled "List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch," and then with the 1992 telemovie ''Christmas in Connecticut''. He has not directed since.



Schwarzenegger's commercial high-water mark was the 1991 sequel to his 1984 hit ''The Terminator'': ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', which was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. In 1993, the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the "International Star of the Decade."<ref name="lifeline"/> His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof ''Last Action Hero'' was released opposite ''Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park'', with the box office  suffering accordingly. His next film, the action comedy ''True Lies'' (1994) was a highly popular send-up of spy films, and saw Schwarzenegger, reunited with ''The Terminator'' director James Cameron, appearing opposite Jamie Lee Curtis.

Shortly thereafter came the comedy ''Junior (film)|Junior'' (1994), directed by ''Twins'' director Ivan Reitman and again playing opposite co-star Danny DeVito. This film brought Schwarzenegger his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor{{ndash}} Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller ''Eraser (movie)|Eraser'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''Batman & Robin'' (1997), where he played the villain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the failure of ''Batman & Robin'', Schwarzenegger's film career and box office prominence went into decline.



Several film projects were announced with Schwarzenegger attached to star, including the remake of ''Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes'', a new film version of ''I Am Legend'', and a World War II film scripted by Quentin Tarantino that would have seen Schwarzenegger play an Austrian.



Instead, he returned after a hiatus with the supernatural thriller ''End of Days (film)|''End of Days'''' (1999), later followed by the action films ''The 6th Day'' (2000) and ''Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage'' (2002). In 2003, he reprised his role in ''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'', which went on to earn over $150 million domestically.

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82-foot) tall ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arnold wants 'Terminator' statue killed |publisher=Killoggs |url=http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |date=2002-09-27 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

===Early politics===

Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican Party (United States)|Republican for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well-known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal and Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained why he was a Republican:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |date=August 31, 2004 |title=Schwarzenegger: No country more welcoming than the USA |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>



{{cquote|I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire.

A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.



But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, "What party is he?" My friend said, "He's a Republican." I said, "Then I am a Republican." And I have been a Republican ever since.}}



In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in ''Stop the Madness'', an anti-Illegal drug trade|drug music video sponsored by the Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the United States presidential election, 1988|1988 Presidential election, accompanying then-Vice President of the United States|Vice President George H.W. Bush at a campaign rally.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}



Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.<ref name="lifeline"/> He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him "Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Republican". He later served as Chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson. Yet, political analysts have identified Schwarzenegger as a liberal, as he has become more left-leaning since his election.<ref name="White">{{cite web |url=http://usliberals.about.com/b/2006/01/14/arnold-schwarzenegger-californias-newest-democrat.htm |title=''Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's Newest Democrat'' |accessdate=2008-04-18 |last=White |first=Deborah |date=2006-01-14}}</ref>



Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a mostly ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio public service announcements to give blood. A small amount of interest was garnered by his wearing of a white t-shirt with the Red Cross on it, while posing with a flexed arm; the image made it into several celebrity magazines.



In an interview with ''Talk (magazine)|Talk'' magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, "I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside."<ref name="governtalk">{{cite news |title=Arnold cast as Governor? |date=1999-10-04 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=90 |work=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> ''The Hollywood Reporter'' claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California.<ref name="governtalk"/> Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, "I'm in show business{{ndash}} I am in the middle of my career.

Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003 episode of ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno''.<ref name="profilear"/> As a candidate in the recall election, Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and "The Running Man" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "Total Recall" (yet another Schwarzenegger starrer). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.<ref name="FirstDebate">{{cite news |last=Grey|first=Barry|title=First debate in California recall election: Snapshot of a political system in crisis |date=2003-11-06 |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml |work=wsws.org |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>



On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received less than 30% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the first foreign-born governor of California since Ireland-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862.



As soon as Schwarzenegger was elected governor, Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown said he would start a drive to recall the governor. Schwarzenegger was equally entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from a sketch partly parodying his bodybuilding career, Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians "girlie men," (a reference from a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch called "Hans and Franz").<ref name="SFGirlieMen">{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger deems opponents 'girlie-men' |date=2004-07-18 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

Schwarzenegger enjoyed a large degree of success and victories in his early governorship,<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/28/local/me-lopez28 LA Times article</ref> including repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a California special election, 2005|special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that "no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you."



Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff.<ref>{{cite web |title=Press Release|url=http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/1191/|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat Phil Angelides, the California State Treasurer, in the California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over one million votes.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Election{{ndash}} Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070219111658/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> The election further enhanced his political credentials.



It is rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010 (he will be term-limited then), if incumbent Senator Barbara Boxer retires.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201476.html|title=Schwarzenegger Remakes Himself as Environmentalist |publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-07-13|first=John |last=Pomfret}}</ref>



Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home.<ref name="governG2"/> Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, "I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential{{ndash}} I was always fascinated by people in control of other people."<ref name="governG2"/> Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes."<ref name="LAWarn"/> Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F.

According to the 2005 Year-in-Review issue of ''Time (magazine)|Time'' magazine, supporters of Schwarzenegger are hoping to amend the Constitution so that he can run for President of the United States.<ref name="LAWarn"/> Indeed, in ''The Simpsons Movie'', Schwarzenegger is portrayed as the President and in the Sylvester Stallone movie ''Demolition Man'', it is revealed there was an amendment to the constitution that allowed him to become President.

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Republican primary of the 2008 U.S. Presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008.

Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley, California.

Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004.

===Environmental record===

On September 27, 2006 Schwarzenegger signed a bill creating the nation’s first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state’s greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California’s emissions by 25 percent to 1990’s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html "Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill" ''Washington Post''.

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006 allowing California to work with the Northeast’s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits they have will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan is set to be in effect in 2009.<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html "Cal Joins Northeast Global Warming Fight" ''Fox News''.

In 2005, Peter Pilz, from the Austrian Green Party, demanded that parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: ''A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic''.<ref name="DamageAustria"/> Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system.



In honor of its most famous son, Schwarzenegger's home town of Graz had its Association football|soccer stadium named The Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium. It is the home of both Grazer AK and Sturm Graz. Following the Stanley Williams execution and after street protests in his hometown, several local politicians began a campaign to remove Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium. Schwarzenegger responded, saying that "to spare the responsible politicians of the city of Graz further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the Liebenau Stadium," and set a tight deadline of just a couple of days to remove his name. Graz officials removed Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium in December 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Graz removes Schwarzenegger name |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4560182.stm |date=2005-12-26 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> It is now officially titled UPC-Arena.

During the Gubernatorial Recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about United States dollar|US$21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thanks to Arnold, California to Pave the Hydrogen Highway |publisher=BMW World |url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=HUMMER H2H Hydrogen Powered Experimental Vehicle |publisher=About.com |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |accessdate=2008-04-18 |last=Wickell |first=Dale}}</ref>

Schwarzenegger has twice crashed motorcycles on public highways, injuring himself in the process. On January 8, 2006, while riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed.

Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predict he will require heart valve replacement surgery in the next two to eight years as his current valve degrades.

His financial independence came from a series of successful business ventures and investments. In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business.
